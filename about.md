The original Race Condition club originally started with Zac Blanco and Stewart
Grant casually running together towards the end of the CoVid-19 pandemic in the
summer of 2021. Stew was trying to run more to improve his rock climbing
abilities (who knew rock climbers needed cardio?). Stew suggested after a
consistent running schedule during the summer that we try to recruit some people
to join for runs.

We started advertising runs to other CSE students in the fall of 2021.
Eventually, more and more people kept joining. By the end of the '21-'22
academic year, runs with 4-6 people were average, and the largest groups were >
10 members strong! We also met and recruited some students from outside the CSE
department too.

From there the club continued to outgrow its CSE roots and transitioned its
original name of "CSE Running Club" to its current "Race Condition Running
Club". The new name was more inclusive and better represented the more diverse
 set of students who had joined. Physics students also made quite a strong
showing as the club grew and helped immensely in recruiting new members to
create Race Condition as we know it today.
