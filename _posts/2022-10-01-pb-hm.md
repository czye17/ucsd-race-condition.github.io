On an overcast day we had a wonderful group come out to see how they measured
up after weeks of some intense (and some not-so-intense) training!

The course was was a winding route circumnavigating mission bay which started on
the easternmost side of Mission Bay in San Diego and wound its way around the
local parks and sidewalk to a finish in the sand down in Pacific Beach.

The weather was exceptional. 60 degrees fahrenheit with a bit of overcast. The
team met up in our shiny new **custom t-shirts** (see picture above) around 5AM
so that we could park at the starting line and get warmed up before a 6:30AM
start.

The race organizers had pacers ranging from 90 minutes to roughly 3 hours. I am
happy to report everyone finished the race. And for some of us it was their
first half marathon ever! It was an exceptionally fun race with great views of
the bay. Most people were happy with the way they took on the course. We all
grabbed lunch together nearby in La Jolla afterwards to celebrate our
achievements and start planning for our next set of running goals.

Onto the next race!
