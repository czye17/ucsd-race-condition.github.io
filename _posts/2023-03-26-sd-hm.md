At a crispy 40 degress fahrenheit, 6 runners dragged themselves out of bed
painfully early to endure some grueling miles that traced out part of downtown
San Diego, ending with a finish in the historic Gaslamp district.

What this course map doesn't show is that around roughly mile 10 there is a
massive 300-foot climb capable of crushing any hopes of achieving a
half-marathon PB. Only the fittest and mentally toughest should expect to
succeed on a course like this one.

We had 2 runners competing in the 5k, which stayed local to the Gaslamp quarter.
Christopher achieved his 5k PB in a blazing time of 21:00 while Tianyi ran her
first ever 5k coming across the line in 37:47

The rest of the runners toed the line just 20 minutes after the start of the 5k.
We had two runners, Alexander and Chris, attempting their first ever half
marathon race with a goal time of sub-2:00. Mia and Olivia, seasoned racers,
were going out there to give their best shot of achieving a PB on a very
difficult course.

The chilly temperatures and sun peeking just over the horizon at the start
actually made for great conditions in the early morning. The half-marathoners
all came out strong at their expected paces. The hill at mile 10 took no pity on
anyone though. Fortunately, everyone made it through alive. Mia crossed the line
at a staggering 1:47 while Alexander and Chris both crushed the 2-hour goal
coming in around 1:53. Olivia rounded out the squad with 2:11, achieving a 5k PB
during the race!

All in all, a successful day for our crew!
